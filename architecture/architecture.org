* Introduction

   The document discusses the design of the overall architecture of
   the hosting of virtual-labs using the one-lab-per-vm model. This is
   as per the requirements specified in "Minutes of the 2013-07-25 Thu
   Expert Committee meeting evaluating VLEADâ€™s progress in virtual lab
   integration" document at *Section-4*, *Item-3*

   VLEAD (Virtual Labs Engineering and Architecture Division) team was
   setup in June 2012 as a central engineering team for integrating
   all the virtual-labs (around 180 in number) across all disciplines
   and institutes onto a common data-center (currently located at IIIT
   Hyderabad). Currently(as of 2013-11-01) around 100 labs are
   version-controlled and around 50 hosted out of IIIT data-centre.

* Basic Architecture

   *Figure-1* represents a basic overview of the overall system, its
   sub-components describing all the actors, entities and they
   interface with each other

** Actors
*** Lab Developer
   An person who has agreed to use the services of VLEAD as per the
   *terms of association* and follows certain standard processes to
   maintain his/her lab during its development life-cycle. In
   specific, the roles are as follows:
     - Checkin the lab contents (repositories containing
       sources,dependencies,scripts and other files) into a
       lab-depository.
     - Keep updating the lab-depository with newer revisons of lab contents.
     - Instantiate a test lab-instance for testing and debugging issues.
     - Instantiate a live lab-instance. 
     - View live lab-instance statistics.
*** Lab Administrator
   An actor who is responsible for administering all the hosted
   labs. In specific, the roles are as follows:
     - Allocate a unique labid and a depository(collection of
       repositories) to a lab
     - Allocation of resources(physical machines,ip address pools,
       vmid pools) to the labmanager and vmmanager
*** Lab User
   These are end-users who use the virtual-labs and run its
   experiments.
** Entities
*** LabDepository

     All labs are allocated a unique-id and a lab-depository by the
     labs administrator. A lab-depository represents a collection of
     various repositories associated with a lab. Each depository has a
     *metadata* repository which is automatically regenerated when any
     of the repositories are modified.

                    repositories of a particular lab

                           their type . This repository is regenerated
                           everytime the lab-developer makes a commit
                           to other repositories.

* Network Architecture
  Presented below is a network architecture diagram of the proposed
  solution:

#+CAPTION: Network Architecture
#+ATTR_LaTeX: width=16cm
   [[file:network-infrastructure.jpg]] 

   - End-users :: They access the labs through a public-url (eg:
                  http://vlabs.ac.in/labid-test ). Internally, the
                  requests are proxied to the actual labvms through a
                  web-proxy over port 80

   - Lab-developers :: 
        + Access to the management-portal is through a public url which
          gets mapped to the portal over port 80.
        + Access to the lab-vms is by a using a forwarding-gateway(eg:
          gateway.virtual-labs.ac.in) that tunnels SSH(Port 22)
          requests to their lab-vms for linux VMs and 
          Remote-Desktop(Port 3389) requests for windows VMs.
	+ Access to the lab-depository is by using a direct SSH(Port 22)
          tunnel to the version-control server.
* Security

  - Firewall rules are configured at the router-interface for
    translating public requests to private requests. These rules allow
    only specific requests on specific ports (as described above) and
    block all other requests.

  - Labs are accessed by users through a web-proxy that logically
    isolates the actual lab-instances from public world. In any case,
    the security of only the web-proxy host is compromised. The
    web-proxy can be configured for additional security and monitored
    for user statistics.

  - Labs are accessed by lab-developers using a gateway that isolates
    the actual lab-vms from the public world. So, in any case the
    security of only the gateway is compromised.

  - All SSH access requests are authenticated by the lab-developer
    LDAP which would be administered by the VLEAD Admin team.

* Performance
  
  - The lab-developer is responsible for performance of the lab and
    hence suggest VLEAD admin the appropriate required memory and cpu
    parameters for creating a VM for the lab.

  - Overall network-performance of all labs would be shared across a
    4Mbps:4Mbps(upward:downward) network link.

* Reliability and Availability Model

  - Redundant network-links would to be configured to make sure labs are
    available 24*7

* Backup Model  

#+CAPTION: Backup Model
#+ATTR_LaTeX: width=8cm
   [[file:backup-model.jpg]]

  - All labs would be backedup as per the following schedule. For full
    backups, the whole image of the VM would be backedup. For
    incremental backups, the lab-developer has to specify the
    appropriate files to be backed-up.

|------------------------------------+-----------|
| Type of Backup                     | Schedule  |
|------------------------------------+-----------|
| Auto Full(VM level)                | Weekly    |
| Auto Incremental(Filesystem level) | Daily     |
| Full/Incremental                   | OnRequest |
|------------------------------------+-----------|
